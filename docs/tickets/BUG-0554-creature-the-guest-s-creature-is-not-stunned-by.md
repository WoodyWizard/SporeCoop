## Report
The guest: "I don't get stunned by other creatures' charge". A charge from an NPC hits the guest but does not stun it as it does in the host's own game.

## Root cause
<!-- observed (runtime, logs, disassembly) vs inferred -->

## Fix
<!-- what changed and why; the switch to turn it off for tests (coop.fix <name>) -->

## Verification
<!-- the test: FAIL without the fix, PASS with it, each with its lab run id (out/lab/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS);
     or a line `no-fail-run: <reason>` (docs only, regression only, not reproducible) -->
