## Report
The guest (3 reports): after dying it still sees other villages on the map that should not exist.
Reports: SporeCoop-report-2026-11-04 190729 (out/reports/2026-11-04, not in git).
Screenshots (the reports' shots/, guest and host at the same session second): s5734, s5771, s5911, s6244: the guest's quest is still "attack the Pink village's centre" while the host's moved on to the Lavender and then the Green village; where the host fights at a village with its hut, members and health bar, the guest's screen shows an empty plaza or another place.
Not analysed yet.

## Root cause
Logs: the reports' sporekit.log of both players (host 17:26-20:15, guest 17:27-19:45 and 19:47-20:09, lined up by the session clock `[s N]`).
Observed (host log): the host's game went Tribe -> Loading -> Tribe at s 5850, 6391 and 7320 (19:06:05, 19:15:06, 19:30:35: a game over and the game's reload of the last save; at 19:06 its members 25 -> 3) while the guest's game stayed in its world (no stage change in its log, only its mirrors 25 -> 3). Observed (lab): tribe_bounce_world out/lab/20261104-202045 FAIL: after the host's game over and reload the guest's game keeps the 3 NPC tribes the host's reloaded world does not have (emptied to 0 members by BUG-0483, but the tribe, its hut and map mark stay). Nothing re-aligns a guest's planet after the host's reload (W2).
* The guest's quest stayed "attack the Pink village" (screenshots s 5734 .. 6244): the host's reloaded world moved on.

## Fix
<!-- what changed and why; the switch to turn it off for tests (coop.fix <name>) -->

## Verification
Lab: tribe_bounce_world (coop_tribe_bounce_world.py) FAIL on 0.7.6 code: out/lab/20261104-202045 (the guest keeps 3
villages the host's reloaded world has not). Package W2.

## History
- 2026-11-04: opened.
- 2026-11-04 (fix/w43-replay, step 0 of 0.7.7): replayed on 0.7.6 code; still open (W2), reproduced in the lab: tribe_bounce_world out/lab/20261104-202045 FAIL.
