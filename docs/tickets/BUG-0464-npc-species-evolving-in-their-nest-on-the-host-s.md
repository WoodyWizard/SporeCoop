## Report
Host's mark (s 2333): 'other species is evolving in nest for host but for guest they are standing still.' The nest evolution sequence (animation / cinematic of an NPC species evolving) is not mirrored. Class G2/G4.
Target: 0.7.4.
<!-- what the player (or the test) saw, in our words; no player names, no paths from their PC -->

## Root cause
<!-- observed (runtime, logs, disassembly) vs inferred -->

## Fix
<!-- what changed and why; the switch to turn it off for tests (coop.fix <name>) -->

## Verification
<!-- the test: FAIL without the fix, PASS with it, each with its lab run id (out/lab/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS);
     or a line `no-fail-run: <reason>` (docs only, regression only, not reproducible) -->
